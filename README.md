# openebs-staging
This repository contains the yaml files that will be run on the openebs-staging setup. 

If you would like to run an application in staging, for a short duration send a Pull Request by putting your yaml files to openebs-staging/experimental. 

If you have an cluster service that needs to run on the staging setup continously, send in a Pull Request to the openebs-staging/release folder -- either as a cluster service or application.
